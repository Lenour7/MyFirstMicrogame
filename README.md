# MyFirstMicrogame
The game that I made was a fps shooter game. You are a character in space fighting monsters. You try to defeat as many as you can. To run the game, open in unity and press play to run the game. You will have to explore on your own because I do not know how to add achivements on the game so keep exploring until you die or defeat all monsters. If you die while fighting a monster, you will respawn again but all your progess will be lost. If you take damage their are some "healing shells" which are scattered around the map you can use to heal yourself. There were already 2 monsters in the game with 2 healing shells but I added 2 extra areas to the map and more shells with more monsters.

Personal Reflection: I believe I did well on this assignment as it was my first one but I think I can do better. In the beginning it was confusing so thats why it was diffucult to do but as I kept adding more and more stuff into the game, it turned out to be easier than I thought. I wish I learned how to change and add different gun skins so I could add something else but it just didn't work out. It was because I completely forgot about the gun and I didn't have enough time to add it.
